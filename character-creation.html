                never truly belong to a single world however they are welcomed
                into human cities and somewhat less into elven lands. Many half-elves choose to live lives of solidarity

                Like others half-orcs have the combined nature of both their lineages allowing them to be more accepted
                in human civilization but that does not come without hardship.
                From their orcish blood half-orcs typically inherit less desirable qualities of impatience and
                ill-temper however they also take on the orcish love of physical
                pleasures such as eating drinking and dancing. Although they are half-human they are unable to fully
                escape the influence of the one-eyed god Gruumsh where some
                Half-Orcs hear the whispers of Gruumsh in their dreams calling them to unleash their inner rage.
