### Wireframe mockups
To produce a basic mockup of the site layouts I used Balsamiq. 

* [Home page wireframe](assests/wireframes/homepage-wireframe.png)
* [Overview page wireframe](assests/wireframes/overview-wireframe.png)
* [Character Creation page wire frame](assests/wireframes/charactercreation-wireframe.png)
* [Contact page wire frame](assests/wireframes/contact-wireframe.png)

There were necessary deviations from the wireframe regarding copyright concerns, initally I had aimed to include a free soundcloud track that users could interact with an listen however looking further into Soundclouds copyright terms and coditions I was unsure if this would be fair use so have instead removed it and kept a clickable link that sends you straight to the soundcloud album and user as this information is important to the user, as is the case with the youtube video by How to be a Great DM.

### Design

Following the overall structure of the wireframes being established, I first set out to find stock images that would relate to a niche horror fantasy without compromising on the aesthetic. I needed a hero image that immediately caught the userâ€™s focus and explained the webpage on its own. After going through unsplash and pexels for a couple of days I was able to find what matched the asthetic I was targetting on shutterstock [https://www.shutterstock.com/](https://www.shutterstock.com/g/WarmTail?searchterm=)

* [Final Image](assests/images/hero-2560.jpg)

### Color Scheme

The image then dictated the color scheme design focus, the goal then became to have striking contrasts that mentally relate to horror but for a contrasting perspective, I needed to clear visible text as the purpose of the website is to draw the user in and give them the information they want to come back to.

By testing different rgba shades of red to match up with my hero image I chose I compared contrasting colors using [https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) of which white (#FFFFFF) gave a good contrast. 

To give a container contrast for the main body of text I used a grey background color which gave a suitable contrast ratio, however later on in development this was changed to black. The black to white contrast is the highest contrast and suited the theme of the website and the goal of making the information stand out.
